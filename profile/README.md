  <h4 align="left">
    Our research focuses on simple questions about complex brain traits: where do they occur (in which cell types)? When do they occur (at which developmental stages)? How do they occur (which quantitative traits of cells are affected)? We aim to develop the methods and datasets required to enable these questions to be answered systematically for any trait for which well-powered genetic data is available.
